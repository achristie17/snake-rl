This code trains a neural network to play Snake using either policy gradient or a genetic algorithm.
When training with the genetic algorithm, the best model in the current generation is saved periodically every k generations (k=10 currently)
The code was developed and tested using Python 3.11.

Dependencies:
Python 3.11
numpy
matplotlib
torch
os
copy
random
re
time
sys

Usage:
Run training.ipynb to train a model with a genetic algorithm
Run figures.ipynb and more_figures.ipynb to generate figures

To watch a model play Snake:
python watch_snake.py [model-file]

NOTE:
To change the state of the game, comment/uncomment the desired get_state function in snake_game.py,
change the neural network input size in the train_genetic_algorithm function at geneticAlg.py line 47
or change the neural network input size in the train_policy_gradient function at train.py line 65
